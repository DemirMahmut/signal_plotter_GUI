# Signal Plotter GUI

A PyQt5-based GUI application for plotting sine and cosine signals and performing Fourier series analysis. This tool allows users to visualize up to three sine and cosine signals with adjustable amplitude, frequency, and phase, as well as to analyze Fourier series components. Ideal for educational purposes and signal-processing tasks.

## Features

- **Sine and Cosine Signal Plotting:**
  - Plot up to three sine and cosine signals with configurable amplitude, frequency, and phase.
  - Display individual signals and their combined total.
  
- **Fourier Series Analysis:**
  - Plot up to three Fourier series components with configurable coefficients.
  - Display individual components and their combined total signal.
  
## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- PyQt5

You can install the dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib pyqt5
```
